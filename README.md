# CHATBOT-encoder-decoder

In this project, I implemented a chatbot using the encoder-decoder algorithm as part of my exploration into the field of deep learning. 
The encoder-decoder architecture has gained widespread attention in the field of natural language processing for tasks such as machine translation and text summarization. 
Furthermore, I aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the encoder-decoder algorithm for the development of chatbots. 

For training my Q&A chatbot a dataset of human-human question-answer examples was used. The chatbot is capable of answering questions from distinctive domains, 
such as: AI, history, politics, sports, â€¦ (The complete dataset was uploaded in ConvDataset directory).

The use of a deep learning encoder-decoder algorithm will enable our chatbot to understand and generate human-like responses to user queries, making it a more effective 
and engaging tool for providing information and assistance in day-to-day life.
